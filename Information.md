# Youtube Channel
I run a youtube channel by the name of _Kasrastani Maths_, dedicated to teaching what I find interesting in math at the time. 
At the current, I am getting back to uploading videos again, editing my second Point-Set Topology lecture, and hopefully being able to upload it soon.
The plan I have the for channel involves eventually talking about topological manifolds, and probably algebraic topology. I want to build everything I talk about in my videos from the ground up.

_Note_: I will also hopefully upload the math talks I do on my youtube channel
# Twitter
I don't tweet much, but I will now tweet out when I'm putting out videos, and what subjects I may do soon.

# MSE
I am also by no means active on Math Stack Exchange, but I still go on there occasionally to see similar problems to my own and look for problems to answer.
