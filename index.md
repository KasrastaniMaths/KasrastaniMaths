# Introduction
I am a 14 year old interested in pure mathematics. Specifically, I am interested in eventually studying Algebraic Topology and possibly K-Theory. Currently, I am studying Abstract Algebra and Category Theory. I live in Ohio, and am hoping to be able to major in pure mathematics one day. I am also very much interested in history, specifically the more modern era, from about 1910-1950. 

# Readings
## Current Reading
I am currently reading Dummit and Foote to learn abstract algebra, and using [Category Theory for the Working Mathematican](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4721-8) by Mac Lane to learn category theory. I am also reading _A Stranger to Myself: The Inhumanities of War in Russia_ by Willy Peter Reese.
## (Hopefully) Future Readings
I plan to read Hatcher for Algebraic Topology, supplemented by Brendon's _Topology and Geometry_. I also hope to read the German Army Regulations on the Medium tank company from 1941.
